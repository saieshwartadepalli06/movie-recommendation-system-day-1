I'm thrilled to share my full-stack data engineering. It's a custom-built Movie Recommendation System that not only suggests films based on your preferences but also provides a sleek interface to enhance user experience.

Key Features:

1. Tailored movie recommendations using a cosine similarity-based algorithm
2. Interactive UI with real-time updates on movie details
3. Seamless integration of backend logic with a responsive front end

This project was a playground for honing my skills in Python, machine learning, and full-stack development. Through this journey, I've delved deep into data manipulation, user interface design, and the intricacies of Flask's web framework.

Built With:

Backend: Flask & Pandas for handling and analyzing data
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JS for a dynamic and responsive design
Machine Learning: SciKit-Learn for the recommendation logic
